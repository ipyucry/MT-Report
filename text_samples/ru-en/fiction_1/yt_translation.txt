— What are you reading, you bastard? — I slap the Staff on the forehead with a book. — Dad will see — he will turn you out of the oprichnina!
— Sorry, Komyaga, the devil got confused, — mutters the Staff.
— You're walking on a knife, you fool! This is seditious obscenity. The Printed Order was cleaned for such books. Did you pick her up there?
— I was not in the Oprichnina at that time. He put the same one in the governor's house. The unclean pushed me in the side.
— Understand, fool, we are a guard pack. We must keep the mind cold and the heart clean.
— I understand, I understand ... — the staff boringly scratches its dark hair under the cap.
— The sovereign does not tolerate abusive words.
— I know.
— You know, burn a dirty book.
— I'll burn it, Komyaga, here's the cross... — he crosses himself with a flourish, hiding the book.
