I read the beginning of the introductory:
In those ancient times in Russia Holy knives were not, therefore men cut beef with dicks.
And the book - read to holes, littered, almost fat from the pages does not drip.
- Why are you reading it, asshole? - I slap Staffy on the forehead with the book. - Your father will see you and kick you out of the oprichnina!
- I'm sorry, Komyaga, I've lost my mind,‚Äù mumbles the staff.
- You're walking on a knife, you fool! It's a lewd and obscene book. They used to cleanse the Printed Order for such books. Is that where you picked it up?
- I wasn't in the oprichnina at that time. I stole it from the voivode's house. The unclean one pushed me in the side.
- Understand, fool, we're a guard pack. We must keep our minds cold and our hearts pure.
- I understand, I understand... - Staff boredly scratches his black hair under his hat.
- The Emperor does not tolerate swear words.
- I know.
- And if you do, burn the dirty book.
- I will, Komyaga, here's the cross... - he crosses himself, hiding the book.
