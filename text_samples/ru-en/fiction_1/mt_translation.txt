"What are you reading, you idiot?" I slap the Staff on the forehead with the book. "If Dad sees you, he'll turn you out of the oprichnina!"

"I was not yet in the oprichnina at that time. He hid the same one in the voivode's house. The evil one pushed me in the side.
"Understand, fool, we're a guard pack. We must keep our minds cold and our hearts pure.
"I understand, I understand..." The staff scratches his black hair under his hat boredly.

"I know.
"And you know, burn the obscene book."
"I'll burn it, Komyaga, these crosses..." he crosses himself in a sweeping manner, hiding the book.
