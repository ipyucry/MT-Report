Read the introductory:
In those old days in Russia there was no knife, so the men cut beef with dicks.
And the book - read to the hole, muzzled, a little fat from the pages does not drip.
- What are you reading, Charmed? -I slap Staff with the book on the forehead. - Dad will see - from the back of the bed you’ll turn!
- Sorry, Komyaga, the devil is a nuisance - Staff mumbles.
- You’re a bit of a fool! It’s a bit of a sloppy job. They used to clean up Printing Orders for these books. Did you pick her up there?
- I was not in the Dobiny yet. The voivode of that in the house and tapped. Impure pushed into the side.
- Understand, fool, we are a guard pack. Should keep the mind in cold and the heart in purity.
- I understand, I understand... Staff is tediously scratching his dark hair under his hat.
- The king does not tolerate words of deceit.
- Know.
- You know, burn the book.
- Burn, Komyaga, there’s the cross... - he will be crucified, hiding a book.
