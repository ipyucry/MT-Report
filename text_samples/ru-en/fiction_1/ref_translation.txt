I read the epigraph:
In those far-off olden times, when Sacred Russia had no knives, carving meat was done with pricks.
This little book has been read till there are holes in it; it’s tattered and grease almost oozes from its pages.
“What are you reading, you impudent lout?” I slap Posokha on the forehead with the book. “If Batya sees it—he’ll throw you out of the oprichnina!”
“I’m sorry, Komiaga, the devil made me do it,” Posokha mutters.
“You’re walking along a knife edge, you dimwit! This obscene stuff is subversive. There were purges in the Printing Department on account of these sorts of books. Is that where you picked it up?”
“I wasn’t in the oprichnina then. I came across it in the house of one of them generals. The devil nudged me.”
“Just understand, you idiot, we’re guards. We have to keep our minds cold and our hearts pure.”
“I understand, I understand…” Posokha scratched the black hair under his hat, in boredom.
“His Majesty can’t stand cusswords.”
“I know.”
“Well, if you know — burn that indecent book!”
“I’ll burn it, Komiaga, here, I’ll swear on it” — and he crosses himself in a sweeping gesture, hiding the book.
