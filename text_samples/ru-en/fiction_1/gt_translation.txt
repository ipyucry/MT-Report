I read the introduction:
In those ancient times in Holy Rus' there were no knives, so the men chopped beef with their dicks.
And the little book is read to holes, shabby, the fat is almost dripping from the pages.
- What are you reading, you rascal? - I slap Posokha on the forehead with the book. - Dad will see - he will throw you out of the oprichnina!
- Forgive me, Komyaga, the devil made me do it, - mutters Posokha.
- You walk on a knife, fool! This is seditious obscenity. The Printing Office was purged for books like this. Is that where you caught her?
- I was not yet in the oprichnina at that time. He stole me into the voivode's house. The devil nudged him in the side.
- Understand, fool, we are a guard pack. We must keep our minds cool and our hearts pure.
- I understand, I understand... - Poshokha boredly scratches his dark hair under his hat.
- The Tsar does not tolerate foul language.
- I know.
- You know, burn the obscene book.
- I will burn it, Komyaga, I cross my heart... - he makes a sweeping sign of the cross, hiding the book.
