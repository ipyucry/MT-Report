Optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence in pre-clinical studies today is an indispensable approach to assess the development of neoplastic transformations, study of proliferative activity of the tumor, its metastatic potential, and also in the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of anti-tumoral agents. In the context of enhancing optical imaging capabilities, it is interesting to develop sensors based on bioluminescent resonance energy (BRET) and independent of external radiation sources.
