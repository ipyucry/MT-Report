Optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence in preclinical studies is currently an indispensable approach in assessing the development of neoplastic transformations, studying the proliferative activity of a tumor, its metastatic potential, as well as in evaluating the therapeutic effect of antitumor agents. As part of the expansion of optical imaging capabilities, it is of interest to create sensors based on bioluminescent resonant energy transfer (BRET) and independent of an external radiation source.
