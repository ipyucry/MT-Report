Optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence in preclinical studies is currently an indispensable approach in assessing the development of neoplastic transformations, studying the proliferative activity of the tumor, its metastatic potential, as well as in assessing the therapeutic effect of antitumor agents. As part of the expansion of optical imaging capabilities, it is interesting to create sensors based on bioluminescent resonant energy transfer (BRET) and independent of an external radiation source.
