Optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence in preclinical studies is currently an indispensable approach in assessing the development of neoplastic transformations, studying the proliferative activity of a tumor, its metastatic potential, and also in assessing the therapeutic effect of antitumor agents. In the context of expanding the capabilities of optical visualization, the creation of sensors based on bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) and independent of an external radiation source is of interest.
