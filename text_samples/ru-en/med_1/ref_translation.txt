Today, in preclinical studies, optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence is indispensable in studying the development of neoplastic transformations, the proliferative activity of the tumor, its metastatic potential, as well as the therapeutic effect of antitumor agents. In order to expand the capabilities of optical imaging, sensors based on the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) mechanism and, therefore, independent of an external light source are being developed.
