Optical bioimaging based on luminescence and fluorescence in preclinical studies is currently an indispensable approach for assessing the development of neoplastic transformations, studying tumor proliferative activity, its metastatic potential, as well as for evaluating the therapeutic effect of antitumor agents. The development of sensors based on bioluminescent resonance resonance energy transfer (BRET), which are independent of external irradiation source, is of interest in expanding the possibilities of optical imaging.
