The project will consist of several formats: a game, a checklist, and content material.
Content material
A longread in which we will tell you how a city dweller can prepare for winter.
It will be divided into two parts: advice and personal opinion.
In the advice section, we will list life hacks related to car care (for example, a reminder to drain the windshield washer fluid in advance so that it does not freeze with the first frost, as well as put a brush and scraper in the car, etc.).
In addition, here we will talk about the importance of choosing tires that will ensure safety on the road - this entire section will be devoted to the advantages of XXXXX tires.
