The Kremlin has stated that an investigation is underway following the death of Alexei Navalny (included in the list of terrorists and extremists) and that all necessary actions are being taken in this regard. This was stated to journalists by the president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov. According to him, in conditions when the results of the investigation have not yet been made public, boorish statements by Western leaders on this matter are unacceptable for statesmen.
