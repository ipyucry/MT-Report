The Kremlin has stated that an investigation is being conducted after the death of Alexei Navalny (listed as a terrorist and extremist) and all necessary actions are being taken in this regard.
The press secretary of the president, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists about this. According to him, in the context of the investigation results have not yet been released, rude statements by Western leaders on this subject are inadmissible for statesmen.
