The Kremlin said that an investigation is underway after the death of Alexei Navalny (listed as a terrorist and extremist) and all necessary actions are being carried out in this regard.
Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of the president, told reporters about this. According to him, in conditions when the results of the investigation have not yet been made public, boorish statements by Western leaders on this issue are unacceptable for state officials.
