The Kremlin said that an investigation into the death of Alexei Navalny (listed as a terrorist and extremist) is underway and all necessary actions in this regard are being carried out.
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. According to him, when the results of the investigation have not yet been made public, boorish statements by Western leaders on this issue are unacceptable for state officials.
