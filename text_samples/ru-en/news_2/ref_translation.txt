The Kremlin has announced that an investigation is underway after the death of Aleksei Navalny (who is included in the list of terrorists and extremists) and that all necessary actions will be carried out in this regard.
This was announced to journalists by the Presidentâ€™s press-secretary, Dmitry Peskov. According to him, boorish statements by Western leaders on this matter are unacceptable for state officials, given that the results of the investigation have not yet been made public.
