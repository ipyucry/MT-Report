The Kremlin said that an investigation is underway after the death of Alexei Navalny (included in the list of terrorists and extremists) and all necessary actions are being taken in this regard.
This was stated to reporters by the press secretary of the President Dmitry Peskov. According to him, in conditions when the results of the investigation have not yet been made public, boorish statements by Western leaders on this matter are unacceptable for statesmen.
