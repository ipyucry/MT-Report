Further, after a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, the author described several cases of initiation of this kind drawn from Russian classical literature, examined the maturation of modern adolescents and analyzed the reasons for such late maturation, and, most importantly, noted the catastrophic tendency of "avoidance of initiation". It also occurred to Victor Yulievich that it was at this age that the Lutherans and Anglicans underwent the process of confirmation, that is, "confirmation", conscious acceptance of the faith, Jewish boys underwent "bar mitzvah", acceptance into the adult community, and Muslims performed circumcision. Thus, it turned out that religious communities attached special importance to this transition from childhood to adulthood, while the atheistic world had completely lost this most important mechanism. It cannot be seriously considered a substitute for joining the pioneer or Komsomol organizations.
