Further, after a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, the author described several cases of initiation of this kind, drawn from Russian classical literature, considered the maturation of modern adolescents and analyzed the reasons for such late maturation, and, most importantly, noted the catastrophic trend of "avoiding initiation". It also occurred to Viktor Yulievich that it was at this age that Lutherans and Anglicans undergo the process of confirmation, that is, "confirmation", conscious acceptance of faith, Jewish boys undergo a "bar mitzvah", acceptance into the adult community, and Muslims are circumcised. Thus, it turned out that religious communities attach special importance to this transition from childhood to adulthood, while the atheistic world has completely lost this important mechanism. You can't seriously consider it a substitute for joining a pioneer or Komsomol organization.
