Further, after a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, the author described several cases of initiation of this kind drawn from Russian classical literature, considered the maturation of modern adolescents and analyzed the reasons for such a late maturation, and, most importantly, noted the disastrous tendency of “initiation avoidance”. It also occurred to Victor Yulievich that it was at this age that Lutherans and Anglicans undergo the process of confirmation, that is, “confirmation,” the conscious acceptance of faith, Jewish boys undergo a “bar mitzvah,” acceptance into the adult community, and Muslims are circumcised. Thus, it appeared that religious communities emphasized this transition from childhood to adulthood, while the atheistic world had completely lost this crucial mechanism. One cannot seriously consider joining a Pioneer or Komsomol organization as a substitute for it.
