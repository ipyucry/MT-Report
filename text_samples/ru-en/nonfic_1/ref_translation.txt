Following a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, the author went on to describe several cases of initiation derived from classical Russian literature, examining the maturation of contemporary adolescents and analyzing the reasons for their tardy development. He also discussed the most alarming phenomenon of all: “initiation avoidance. ” It also occurred to Victor Yulievich that at just this age, Lutherans and Anglicans undergo the process of Confirmation, conscious acceptance of the faith; Jewish boys celebrate their bar mitzvahs, in which they are inducted into the adult community; and Muslims are circumcised. Thus, it seems that communities of believers attach particular significance to this transition from childhood to adulthood, whereas the atheist world has completely foregone this crucial mechanism. Becoming a Pioneer or a Komsomol member could hardly be considered a serious replacement for this practice.
