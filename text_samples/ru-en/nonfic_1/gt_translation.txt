Further, after a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, the author described several cases of initiation of this kind, taken from Russian classical literature, examined the maturation of modern teenagers and analyzed the reasons for such late maturation, and, most importantly, noted the catastrophic tendency of "avoiding initiation." It also occurred to Viktor Yulyevich that it is at this age that Lutherans and Anglicans undergo the process of confirmation, that is, "confirmation," a conscious acceptance of faith, Jewish boys undergo "bar mitzvah," acceptance into the community of adults, and Muslims undergo circumcision. Thus, it turned out that communities of religious people attach special importance to this transition from childhood to adulthood, while the atheistic world has completely lost this most important mechanism. It is impossible to seriously consider joining a pioneer or Komsomol organization as a replacement for it.
