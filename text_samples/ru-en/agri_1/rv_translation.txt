Modern intensive crop technologies, combining multiple times per season mechanical treatment of the soil, frequent use of pesticides, high doses of mineral fertilizers lead to its destructuring, The depletion of micro- and mycobiota and the shift in species composition towards phytopathogenic forms, which inevitably disrupts normal functioning of ecosystems. However, the species composition of the microflora that can populate the rixosfera is largely responsible for the successful development of the plant organism and ultimately for the relatively high yields of a given crop.
