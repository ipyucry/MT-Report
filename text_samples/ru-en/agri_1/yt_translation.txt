Modern intensive technologies of crop cultivation, combining repeated seasonal mechanical tillage, frequent use of pesticides, high doses of mineral fertilizers, lead to its destruction, depletion of micro- and mycobiota and a shift in species composition towards phytopathogenic forms, as a result of which the normal functioning of ecosystems is inevitably disrupted. At the same time, the species composition of the microflora, capable of colonizing the rhizosphere, largely determines the successful development of a plant organism and, ultimately, obtaining relatively high yields of a particular crop.
