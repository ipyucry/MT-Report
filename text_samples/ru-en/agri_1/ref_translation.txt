Todayâ€™s intensive crop cultivation technologies, combining multiple mechanical tillage operations during the season and frequent uses of pesticides and large doses of mineral fertilizers, tend to destructure the soil, deplete it of its micro- and mycobiota, whose species composition, in turn, tends to shift towards phytopathogenic forms. As a result, the normal functioning of its ecosystems is inevitably disrupted. At the same time, it is the species composition of the microflora capable of populating the rhizosphere that largely determines the successful development of plant organisms and, ultimately, the obtainment of relatively high yields for a particular crop.
