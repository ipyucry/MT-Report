Modern intensive technologies of agricultural crops cultivation, combining multiple mechanical tillage, frequent use of pesticides, high doses of mineral fertilizers, lead to its destructurization, impoverishment of micro- and mycobiota and shift of species composition towards phytopathogenic forms, as a result of which the normal functioning of ecosystems is inevitably disturbed. At the same time, the species composition of microflora, capable of populating the rhizosphere, largely determines the successful development of plant organism and, ultimately, obtaining relatively high yields of a particular crop.
