Modern intensive technologies of agricultural crop cultivation, combining multiple mechanical tillage per season, frequent use of pesticides, high doses of mineral fertilizers lead to its destructuring, depletion of micro- and mycobiota and a shift in species composition towards phytopathogenic forms, as a result of which the normal functioning of ecosystems is inevitably disrupted. At the same time, the species composition of microflora capable of populating the rhizosphere largely determines the successful development of a plant organism and, ultimately, obtaining relatively high yields of a particular crop.
