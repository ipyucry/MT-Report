Modern intensive technologies of crop cultivation, combining multiple mechanical tillage per season, frequent use of pesticides, high doses of mineral fertilizers lead to its destructuring, impoverishment of micro- and mycobiota and a shift in the species composition towards phytopathogenic forms, as a result of which the normal functioning of ecosystems is inevitably disrupted. At the same time, the species composition of the microflora, capable of populating the rhizosphere, largely determines the successful development of a plant organism and, ultimately, the obtaining of relatively high yields of a particular crop.
