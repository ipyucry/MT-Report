If any of the anabolic-androgenic steroids can be produced by the body itself, the sample will be considered to contain such a prohibited substance in cases where the concentration of such a prohibited substance or the concentration of its metabolites or markers and/or their corresponding ratios in the athlete's sample are outside the range of norms that are normal for humans and are unlikely to correspond to normal endogenous production by the body. A Sample shall not be considered to contain a Prohibited Substance if the Athlete provides evidence that the concentration of the Prohibited Substance or its metabolites or markers and/or their respective ratios in the Athlete's Sample may be due to the Athlete's condition.
