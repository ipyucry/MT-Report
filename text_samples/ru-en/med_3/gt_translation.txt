If any of the anabolic androgenic steroids can be produced by the body itself, a Sample will be considered to contain such Prohibited Substance when the concentration of such Prohibited Substance or the concentration of its metabolites or markers and/or their respective ratios in the Athlete's Sample is outside the normal range for humans and is unlikely to be consistent with normal endogenous production by the body. A Sample will not be considered to contain a Prohibited Substance if the Athlete demonstrates that the concentration of the Prohibited Substance or its metabolites or markers and/or their respective ratios in the Athlete's Sample is likely to be caused by a pathological or physiological condition of the Athlete.
