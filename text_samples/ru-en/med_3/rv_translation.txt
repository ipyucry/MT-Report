If any anabolic androgenic steroid can be produced by the body itself, the sample shall be considered to contain such a prohibited substance when the concentration of such a prohibited substance or its metabolites, either the markers and/or their corresponding ratios in a athlete’s sample are outside the range of standards common to humans, and hardly can correspond to normal endogenous production by the body. The sample is not considered to contain a prohibited substance if the athlete provides evidence that the concentration of the banned substance or its metabolites, either markers and/or their respective ratios in the athlete’s sample may be caused by his pathological or physiological condition.
