Where any of the anabolic androgenic steroids may be produced by the body, a Sample shall be deemed to contain such Prohibited Substance where the concentration of such Prohibited Substance or the concentration of its Metabolites or markers and/or their respective ratios in an Athlete's Sample is outside the range of normal human norms and is unlikely to be consistent with normal endogenous production by the body. A Sample shall not be deemed to contain a Prohibited Substance if the Athlete establishes that the concentration of the Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers and/or their respective ratios in the Athlete's Sample is attributable to the Athlete's pathological or physiological condition.
