If any of the anabolic androgenic steroids can be produced by the body itself, the sample will be considered to contain such a prohibited substance in cases where the concentration of such a prohibited substance or the concentration of its metabolites or markers and/or their corresponding ratios in the athlete's sample go beyond the range of norms that are common to humans, and are unlikely to correspond to the usual endogenous production by the body. A sample is not considered to contain a Prohibited Substance if the Athlete provides evidence that the concentration of the prohibited substance or its metabolites, or markers and/or their corresponding ratios in the athlete's sample may be caused by his pathological or physiological condition.
