To point a domain to a hosting or server, use DNS servers xx3.xxx.xx, xx4.xxx.xx and xx8.xxx.xx. In this case, you need to link the domain to the IP address in the XXXXX account.
To link a domain to an IP address:
1. Log in to your account.
2. In the "Services" section, select My domains:
3. Click on the domain name:
4. Scroll down the page. In the "DNS Premium" line, select Control Panel:
5. Click "Add new record":
6. Fill in the fields:
- Name — the subdomain for which you want to add a record. If you are linking the main domain, specify @.
- Type — select A;
- IP address — the IP address to which you want to link the domain.
Then click "Add".
