To direct the domain to a hosting or server, use the DNS servers xx3.xxx.xx, xx4.xxx.xx, and xx8.xxx.xx. In this case, you need to link the domain to the IP address in the XXXXX account.
To bind a domain to an IP address:
1. Log in to your personal account.
2. In the Services section, select My Domains:
3. Click on the domain name:
4. Scroll down the page. In the "DNS Premium" line, select Control Panel:
5. Click "Add new entry":
6. Fill in the fields:
- Name — the subdomain for which you want to add a record. If you're linking the primary domain, specify @.
- Type — select A;
- IP address — the IP address to which you want to bind the domain.
Then click Add.
