To point a domain to a hosting or server, use DNS servers xx3.xxx.xx, xx4.xxx.xx and xx8.xxx.xx. In this case, you must bind the domain to an IP address in the XXXXX account.
To bind a domain to an IP address:
1. Authorize in your personal account.
2.	In the “Services” section, select My Domains:
3.	Click on the domain name:
4.	Scroll down the page. Under DNS Premium, select Control Panel:
5.	Click on “Add a new record”:
6.	Fill in the fields:
- Name - the subdomain for which you want to add a record. If you are linking the main domain, specify @.
- Type - select A;
- IP address - the IP address to which you want to bind the domain.
Then click “Add”.
