These are my friends, parents. A few years I traveled all over the former Soviet Union, because homo soveticus - it is not only Russians, but also Belarusians, Turkmens, Ukrainians, Kazakhs... Now we live in different countries, speak different languages, but you can’t mistake us with anyone. You’ll know! All of us, people of socialism, like and unlike other people - we have our own dictionary, our own ideas about good and evil, heroes and martyrs. We have a special relationship with death. In the stories I write down, words like «shoot», «shoot», «eliminate», «put to waste» or such Soviet options of disappearance as: «arrest», «ten years without the right to be written off», «emigration» are constantly being used. How much can a human life cost if we remember that millions have recently died? We are full of hatred and prejudice.
