These are my acquaintances, friends, and parents. For several years I traveled all over the former Soviet Union, because homo soveticus is not only Russians, but also Belarusians, Turkmens, Ukrainians, Kazakhs... Now we live in different countries, speak different languages, but you can't confuse us with anyone. You'll know right away! All of us, people from socialism, are similar and unlike other people â€“ we have our own vocabulary, our own ideas about good and evil, about heroes and martyrs. We have a special relationship with death. Constantly in the stories that I write down, the words "shoot", "shoot", "liquidate", "waste" or such Soviet variants of disappearance as: "arrest", "ten years without the right to correspond", "emigration" cut my ear. How much can a human life be worth if we remember that millions have recently died? We are full of hatred and prejudice.
