These are my acquaintances, friends, parents. For several years, I traveled all over the former Soviet Union, because homo soveticus is not only Russians, but also Belarusians, Turkmens, Ukrainians, Kazakhs... Now we live in different countries, speak different languages, but we cannot be confused with anyone else. You'll know right away! All of us, people from socialism, similar and unlike other people â€“ we have our own vocabulary, our own ideas about good and evil, about heroes and martyrs. We have a special relationship with death. In the stories that I write, the words "shoot", "shoot", "liquidate", "expend" or such Soviet versions of disappearance as "arrest", "ten years without the right of correspondence", "emigration" constantly hurt the ear. How much can a human life be worth if we remember that millions died recently? We are full of hatred and prejudice.
