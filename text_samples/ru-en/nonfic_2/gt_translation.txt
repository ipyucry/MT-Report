These are my acquaintances, friends, parents. For several years I traveled all over the former Soviet Union, because homo soveticus is not only Russians, but also Belarusians, Turkmens, Ukrainians, Kazakhs... Now we live in different countries, speak different languages, but you can't confuse us with anyone else. You'll recognize us right away! All of us, people from socialism, similar and different from other people - we have our own vocabulary, our own ideas about good and evil, heroes and martyrs. We have a special relationship with death. In the stories I write down, the words "shoot", "execute", "liquidate", "dispose of" or such Soviet versions of disappearance as "arrest", "ten years without the right to correspondence", "emigration" constantly grate on the ear. How much can a human life be worth if we remember that millions died recently? We are full of hatred and prejudice.
