These are my acquaintances, friends, parents. For several years I traveled all over the former Soviet Union, because homo soveticus is not only Russians, but also Belarusians, Turkmens, Ukrainians, Kazakhs... Now we live in different countries, speak different languages, but you can't confuse us with anyone. You can recognize us at once! All of us, people from socialism, are similar and different from other people - we have our own vocabulary, our own ideas about good and evil, about heroes and martyrs. We have a special relationship with death. Constantly in the stories I write down, the words that cut the ear are: “shoot”, “shoot”, “liquidate”, “let go to waste” or such Soviet variants of disappearance as: “arrest,” ‘ten years without the right to correspondence,’ ”emigration.” How much can a human life be worth when we remember that recently millions were killed? We are full of hatred and prejudice.
