One day I will write some honest personal thread about open relationships and open marriage (in my case, everything is very tricky and not entirely honest with myself, and it is I who is jealous and furious, not my partners, although I initiated all this, and in my ideal crazy world I date whoever I want, and my partners do NOT ahahaðŸ‘»). Because I rarely see non-idealized attempts to describe all this and reflection. I see either shitstorms or some kind of reduction. But this will be some kind of fucking exhibitionism and God forbid for now
