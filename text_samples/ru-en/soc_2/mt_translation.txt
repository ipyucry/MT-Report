One day I'll write some honest personal thread about open relationships and open marriage (specifically, everyone there is very cunning and not completely honest with myself, and it's me who is jealous and mad, not my partners, although I initiated it all, and in my ideal crazy world I date whoever I want, and my partners are NOT hahahaðŸ‘»). Because I rarely see non-idealized attempts to describe all this and reflection. I see either a shit, or some kind of reduction. But this will be fucking exhibitionism and God forbid
