One of these days I'm going to write some honest personal tred about open relationships and open marriage (specifically I'm very sly and not completely honest with myself there, and I'm the one who's jealous and freaking out, not my partners, even though I initiated it all, and in my perfect crazy world I date whoever I want and my partners DO NOT ahahahaðŸ‘»). Because I rarely see non-idealized attempts at describing it all and reflection. I either see fighting or some kind of reduction. But that would be fucking exhibitionist and so far, God forbid.
