One day I will write some honest personal thread about an open relationship and an open marriage (specifically, I have everything there very cunningly and not completely honest with myself, and it's me who am jealous and furious, not my partners, although I initiated it all, and in my ideal crazy world I meet with whom I want And my partners DON'T have ahahaðŸ‘»). Because I rarely see imperfect attempts to describe all this and reflection. I see either srachi or some kind of reduction. But it's going to be fucking exhibitionism and God forbid for now
