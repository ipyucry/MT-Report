One day Iâ€™ll write an honest and personal thread about open relationships and marriages (in my case itâ€™s real fkn mess since Iâ€™m the one not 100% honest with myself and end up feeling jealous and going apeshit, not my partners, despite me being the initiator of all this, â€˜cause in my ideal and twisted world I date as many people as I like and my partners DONâ€™T hahaðŸ‘»). â€˜Cause I rarely see non-idealized attempts at describing and analyzing this. Itâ€™s either pointless arguing or oversimplification. But it would be real fucking exhibitionism if I do this so god forbid
