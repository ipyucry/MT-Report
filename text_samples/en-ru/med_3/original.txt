This coarse and crude surgery. This evil tumour, changing this man's very nature, destroying both himself and his family. It's time to go. As I watched my sucker down the microscope, controlled by my invisible hands, working on the poor man's brain, teasing and pulling out the tumour, I told myself that I wouldn't have panicked in the past. I would just have shrugged and got on with it. But now that my surgical career was coming to an end, I could feel the defensive psychological armour that I had worn for so many years starting to fall away, leaving me as naked as my patients. Bitter experience of similar cases to Mr Williams's told me that the best outcome for this man would be if the operation killed him â€• but I felt unable to let that happen.
