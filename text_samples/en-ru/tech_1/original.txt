Jacket platforms are used as permanent production structures. Jack-up platforms serve the offshore industry as an exploration structure. The jack-up combines the mobility of floating structure with the jacket platformâ€™s properties of wave transparency and fixity. The jacket structure is the most common fixed offshore platform in the world. It was first used in the Gulf of Mexico and has since been adapted and modified for use all over the world. It comes in a variety of styles from the single-legged (monopod) to multi-legged structures.
