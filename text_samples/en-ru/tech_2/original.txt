Progressive cavity centrifuge feed pump
Specialists in creating value through solution-oriented packaging, integration, and system customization.
System Integration
Integrated waste management and solids treatment systems integrate PC feed pumps directly into the package therefore reducing installation and erection head-aches.
System Mobility
As a result of their small foot print, the integration of PC pumps can be efficiently integrated into mobile treatment system packages. To ensure a well-balanced feed with consistent feed pressure, our company can supply a variety of custom-configured progressive-cavity feed pumps (“PC pumps”). PC pumps can extend the life of a centrifuge and reduce overall operations and maintenance costs when properly operated. PC Pump packages can be supplied in a variety of skid configurations (i.e. wide field skid and narrow plant skid) and a variety of motor installation configurations (i.e. in-line, offset, and “piggy-back”).
