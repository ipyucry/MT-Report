Sticky chromosomes
Interest in telomeres was first kindled in the 1930s when the researchers Barbara McClintock and Hermann Muller noticed that the ends of chromosome appeared to play some protective role. Barbara McClintock observed that chromosomes lacking end parts became “sticky” – they often fused to each other or got broken down. Similar observations were reported by Hermann Muller, who coined the term telomere from the Greek telos (end) and meros (part).At that time, the internal structure of the chromosome was essentially unknown. Researchers knew that chromosomes carry the genetic material, and suspected that the telomeres protect it from degradation, but they could not understand how.
