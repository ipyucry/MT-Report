The theme was “collective farm. ” White tulips were delivered from Finland. A dozen birch trees were uprooted and placed under a sun lamp, so the buds opened on the day of the party. Embassy staff went to the Moscow Zoo and brought mountain goats — a half dozen of them were put on a platform at the head of the buffet table. Fishing nets were soaked in gold powder and glue, stretched along the marble walls of the huge ballroom, and filled with hundreds of zebra finches, which fluttered and sang merrily behind the gold mesh. The 500 guests arrived at midnight, watching in awe as projected images surrounded them. Flowers appeared on the walls, a constellation of stars complete with a bright moon turned up on the high-domed ceiling, and multicolored spotlights shone down on the guests from the balcony.
