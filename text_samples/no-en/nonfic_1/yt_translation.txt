In the 1840s, the young doctor Herman Wedel Major came into the picture. He was 23 years younger than Holst, belonged to the next generation of doctors and grew into a society that was already under intense construction. Major's efforts to build psychiatry are remarkable. His introduction of the Control commissions, for example, must have been very far-sighted. Major had not had Psychiatry on his schedule in the study, but he had gained insight into the subject through, among other things, his fiance's illness. It had obviously shaped his view of individual patients ' needs.
