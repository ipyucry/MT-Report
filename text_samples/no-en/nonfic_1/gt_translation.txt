In the 1840s, the young doctor Herman Wedel Major entered the picture. He was 23 years younger than Holst, belonged to the next generation of doctors and grew into a society that was already undergoing intense development. Major's efforts to build up psychiatry are remarkable. His introduction of the control commissions, for example, must have been very far-sighted. Major had not had psychiatry on his study timetable, but he had gained insight into the subject through, among other things, his fiancee's illness. It had obviously shaped his view of the individual patients' needs.
