The young doctor Herman Wedel Major entered the scene in the 1840s. He was 23 years younger than Holst, belonged to the next generation of doctors and spent his formative years in a society that was already undergoing an intense process of development. Major’s efforts to build up the field of psychiatry are remarkable. His introduction of the control commissions, for example, must have been very far-sighted. Psychiatry had not been on Major’s class timetable when he studied for his degree, but his fiancée’s illness was one factor which helped him to obtain an insight into the subject. It had clearly formed his opinion on the needs of individual patients.
