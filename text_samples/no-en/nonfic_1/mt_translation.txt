In the 1840s, the young doctor Herman Wedel Major came into the picture. He was 23 years younger than Holst, belonged to the next generation of doctors and grew into a society that was already under intense construction. Major's efforts to build up psychiatry are remarkable. His introduction of the control commissions, for example, must have been very far-sighted. Major had not had psychiatry on his curriculum in his studies, but he had gained insight into the subject through, among other things, his fianc√©e's illness. This had obviously shaped his view of the needs of individual patients.
