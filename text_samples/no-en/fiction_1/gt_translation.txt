I still have no doubt about the following four characteristics. First, the gap is dark, so dark that it can hardly be called anything other than black. Second, it is, unfortunately, bottomless. Furthermore, it has walls, it does not resemble the cosmos or the sea below the surface, rather it appears as a kind of tunnel, or more precisely, a well; for the last thing I am sure of is that the gap extends in one particular direction, namely downwards.
