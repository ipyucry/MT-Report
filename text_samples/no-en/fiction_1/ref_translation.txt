I have no doubts about the following four characteristics. Firstly, the gap is dark, so dark that it is hard to describe as anything other than black. Secondly, and regrettably, it is also bottomless. In addition to this it has walls, resembling not the cosmos or the sea beneath its surface, but a kind of tunnel, or, more precisely, a well; because the last thing of which I am certain is that the gap extends in one fixed directionâ€”downwards.
