However, I have no doubts about the following four characteristics. Firstly, the gap is dark, so dark that it can hardly be called anything other than black. Secondly, it is, unfortunately, bottomless. Furthermore, it has walls, it doesn't resemble the cosmos or the ocean below the surface, rather it appears as a kind of tunnel, or more precisely, a well; because the last thing I'm sure of is that the gap extends in one particular direction, namely downwards.
