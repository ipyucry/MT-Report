A total of 1644 plasma units were collected from 266 plasma donors at 12 blood banks. Median disease score was 5 (interquartile range 3–6), and 15 donors had recovered from pneumonia and/or been hospitalised. A total of 599/1644 plasma units from 106/266 donors met our requirement for SARS-CoV-2 antibody content (> 60 % inhibition of virus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) or positive virus neutralisation test. The antibody level in donors waned over time following infection, and showed no clear correlation with disease score.
