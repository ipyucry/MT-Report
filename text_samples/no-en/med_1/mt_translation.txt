A total of 266 plasma donors at 12 blood banks were collected for 1,644 plasma units. The median disease score was 5 (interquartile range 3â€“6), and 15 donors had pneumonia and/or been hospitalised. A total of 599/1,644 plasma units from 106/266 donors met our requirements for SARS-CoV-2 antibody content (> 60% inhibition of virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) or positive virus neutralization test. Antibody levels in the donors declined with time after infection and showed no clear association with disease scores.
