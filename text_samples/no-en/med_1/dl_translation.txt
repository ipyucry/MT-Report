A total of 266 plasma donors at 12 blood banks were depleted of 1,644 plasma units. The median disease score was 5 (interquartile range 3-6), and 15 donors had had pneumonia and/or been hospitalized. A total of 599/1,644 plasma units from 106/266 donors met our requirements for SARS-CoV-2 antibody content (>60% inhibition of virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) or positive virus neutralization test. Donor antibody levels decreased with time post-infection and showed no clear correlation with disease score.
