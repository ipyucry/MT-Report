ยง 5-10. Board of the institution
The municipal council and the county council can set up their own boards for municipal or county municipal institutions. Such boards must have at least three members.

The municipal board and the county council make their own provisions on the board's composition. It can be determined that the board is to be appointed in whole or in part by the director of the municipality, or that the board is to be chosen in whole or in part by the employees or users of the institution in question. Members who are not to be appointed or elected according to the second sentence, are elected by the municipal council or the county council itself.

The municipal board and the county council can themselves give the board of municipal or county municipal institutions the authority to make decisions concerning the operation and organization of the business.

The municipal board and the county council can themselves reorganize or close down such boards at any time.
