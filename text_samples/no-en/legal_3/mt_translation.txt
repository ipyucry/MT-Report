Section 5-10.Board of Directors of an institution
The municipal council and the county council may themselves establish separate boards for municipal or county municipal institutions. Such boards must have at least three members.

The municipal council and the county council themselves make decisions on the composition of the board. It may be stipulated that the board shall be wholly or partly appointed by the municipal director, or that the board shall be wholly or partly elected by the employees or users of the institution in question. Members who are not to be appointed or elected pursuant to the second sentence are elected by the municipal council or the county council itself.

The municipal council and the county council may themselves give the board of municipal or county municipal institutions the authority to make decisions concerning the operation and organisation of the enterprise.

The municipal council and the county council may themselves reorganise or abolish such boards at any time.
