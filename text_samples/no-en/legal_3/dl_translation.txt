ยง Section 5-10. Board of directors for institutions
The municipal council and county council may establish their own boards for municipal or county institutions. Such boards shall have at least three members.

The municipal council and county council themselves lay down provisions regarding the composition of the board. It may be stipulated that the board shall be wholly or partly appointed by the municipal director, or that the board shall be wholly or partly elected by the employees or users of the institution in question. Members who are not to be appointed or elected in accordance with the second sentence are elected by the municipal council or county council itself.

The municipal council and county council may themselves give the board of directors of municipal or county institutions the authority to make decisions concerning the operation and organization of the institution.

The municipal and county councils may themselves reorganize or abolish such boards at any time.
