Section 5-10.Boards of institutions
The municipal council and the county council may themselves appoint separate boards for municipal or county institutions. Such boards shall have no fewer than three members.

The municipal council and the county council themselves issue provisions concerning the composition of the board. They may determine that the board shall wholly or partly be appointed by the chief municipal executive, or that the board shall wholly or partly be elected by the employees or the users of the institution concerned. Members who shall not be appointed or elected in such a manner are elected by the municipal council and the county council themselves.

The municipal council and the county council may themselves grant the board of municipal or county authority institutions the authority to make decisions concerning the running and organisation of the institution.

The municipal council and the county council may themselves at any time reorganise or disband such boards.
