ยง 5-10.Board of directors
The Municipal Council and the county council may establish their own boards for municipal or county institutions. Such boards shall have at least three members.

The municipal and county councils themselves make provisions on the composition of the board. It may be stipulated that the board shall be wholly or partly appointed by the municipal director, or that the board shall be wholly or partly elected by the employees or users of the institution in question. Members who are not to be appointed or elected under the second sentence shall be elected by the municipal council or the county council itself.

The Municipal Council and the county council may themselves grant the board of municipal or county municipal institutions the authority to make decisions concerning the operation and organisation of the enterprise.

The municipal and county councils may themselves reorganize or terminate such boards at any time.
