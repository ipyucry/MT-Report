The idea is simple. We realized that it was a bit too awesome that good scientific articles and other medical subject matter should only be available to the small group of people who speak Norwegian. Although the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association obviously has, and should have, Norwegian doctors as its primary target group, much of the material we publish may be of interest outside Norway. How many times have I been annoyed by hits in PubMed that are meaningless to me. The title, and perhaps the summary, seem relevant, but the content is inaccessible because I do not master the language.
