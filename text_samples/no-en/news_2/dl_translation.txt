The idea is simple. We realized that it was a bit too crude that good scientific articles and other medical material should only be available to the small group of people who speak Norwegian. Although the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association obviously has, and should have, Norwegian doctors as its primary target audience, much of the material we publish may be of interest outside Norway. How many times have I been annoyed by hits in PubMed that are meaningless to me? The title, and perhaps the abstract, seems relevant, but the content is inaccessible because I am not fluent in the language.
