The idea is simple. We realized that it was a bit too awesome that good scientific articles and other medical material should only be available to the small group of people who speak Norwegian. Although the Journal obviously has, and will have, Norwegian doctors as its primary target group, much of the material we publish may be of interest outside Norway. How many times have I been annoyed by hits in PubMed that are meaningless to me. Title, and maybe summary, seems relevant, but the content is inaccessible because I am not fluent in the language.
