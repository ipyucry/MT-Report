The idea is a simple one. We realised that it was wasteful to make good-quality scientific articles and other medical writing available only to the small group of people who can read Norwegian. Even though the journal of course has, and should have, Norwegian doctors as its primary target group, much of the material that we publish may also be of interest outside Norway. Have I not many times been irked by hits in PubMed that remain meaningless to me. Even though the title and perhaps the abstract appear to be relevant, the content is inaccessible because I cannot read the language.
