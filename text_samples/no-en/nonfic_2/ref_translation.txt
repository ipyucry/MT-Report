Norway had been a Danish province for 400 years when war broke out in Europe in 1802. The French emperor Napoleon fought against everyone and suffered a decisive defeat. The Danish king, allied with France, also faced defeat. In January 1814, the peace treaty was signed in Kiel. Denmark had to cede Norway to Sweden, releasing all Norwegians from their oath of allegiance to the Danish king. “The Swedish king did not have the infrastructure ready to govern Norway, creating a power vacuum. Norwegian politicians took advantage of this,” says Dahl. The Danish king did not want to give up easily. He sent Prince Christian Frederik to Norway in an attempt to retain the country for the Danish royal family.
