Norway had been a Danish province for 400 years, when in 1802 war broke out in Europe. The French emperor Napoleon fought everyone and lost thoroughly. So did the Danish king, who stood on the side of France. The Danish heir to the throne Christian Frederik went to Norway to become king. He was elected unanimously on Nov.17. may 1814. In January 1814, the peace treaty was signed in Kiel. Denmark had to give up Norway to Sweden. And all the Norwegians were released from their oath of allegiance to the Danish king. - The Swedish King was not ready with a power apparatus to rule Norway, so a vacuum arose. Norwegian politicians took advantage of this, says Dahl. The Danish king would not give up. He sent Prince Christian Frederik, to Norway in an attempt to keep the land for the Danish royal family.
