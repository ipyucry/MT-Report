Norway had been a Danish province for 400 years, when in 1802 war broke out in Europe. The French emperor Napoleon fights everyone and loses thoroughly. So did the Danish king, who stood on France's side. The Danish heir to the throne Christian Frederik went to Norway to become king. He was unanimously elected at Eidsvoll on 17 May 1814. In January 1814, the peace treaty was signed in Kiel. Denmark had to give up Norway to Sweden. And all Norwegians were released from their oath of allegiance to the Danish king. - The Swedish king was not ready with a power apparatus to rule Norway, so a vacuum arose. Norwegian politicians took advantage of that, says Dahl. The Danish king would not give up. He sent Prince Christian Frederik to Norway in an attempt to keep the country for the Danish royal family.
