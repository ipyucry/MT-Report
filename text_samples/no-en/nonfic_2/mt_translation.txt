Norway had been a Danish province for 400 years, when war broke out in Europe in 1802. The French emperor Napoleon fought against everyone and lost heavily. So did the Danish king, who was on France's side. The Danish heir to the throne Christian Frederik went to Norway to become king. He was unanimously elected at Eidsvoll on 17 May 1814. In January 1814, the peace treaty was signed in Kiel. Denmark had to give up Norway to Sweden. And all Norwegians were released from their oath of allegiance to the Danish king. "The Swedish king was not ready with a power apparatus to govern Norway, so a vacuum arose. Norwegian politicians took advantage of that," says Dahl. The Danish king did not want to give up. He sent Prince Christian Frederik to Norway in an attempt to keep the land for the Danish royal family.
