Norway had been a Danish province for 400 years when war broke out in Europe in 1802. The French emperor Napoleon fought everyone and lost thoroughly. So did the Danish king, who sided with France. The Danish heir to the throne, Christian Frederik, went to Norway to become king. He was unanimously elected at Eidsvoll on May 17, 1814. In January 1814, the peace treaty was signed in Kiel. Denmark had to give up Norway to Sweden. All Norwegians were released from their oath of allegiance to the Danish king. - The Swedish king did not have the power to govern Norway, so there was a vacuum. Norwegian politicians took advantage of this,‚Äù says Dahl. The Danish king would not give up. He sent Prince Christian Frederik to Norway in an attempt to keep the country for the Danish royal family.
