The telephone directory is getting thinner and thinner. People disappear from photography, never to return. Doors unopened for years are lost in the bushes and flowers on the wallpaper. Hundreds of years pass in an hour at the kitchen window. Alone in his cabin, Columbus begins to write a letter: “India must be paradise-impossible to find until one is dead.” Yet Columbus found India. In the same way that we find the truth about our lives and get up every morning with renewed energy. A row of tools at attention in front of the map of terra incognita. The craftsman turns the hourglass: every grain of sand falls like a stone.
